# Hi there, I'm Daniil 👋

**Technical Partner for Early-Stage Founders** — I own the full path from unclear requirements to shipped product.

Specialized in **legacy system integration**, **complex domain logic** (FinTech, Healthcare), and **team coordination** without the chaos.

*5+ years in production • 50+ products shipped • 30+ founders helped*

## 🚀 What I Do

I don't just write code — I own **discovery, architecture, team coordination, and delivery**. You get clarity and a working product, not just tickets closed.

- **Full-cycle product development** — from vague founder brief to shipped MVP in 6-12 weeks
- **Legacy system integration** — migrated 40+ branch operations without a single minute of downtime
- **Technical leadership** — coordinated 5-7 engineer teams through 24+ sprint cycles
- **Complex domains** — FinTech loan calculations, Healthcare compliance, E-Commerce at scale

## 💼 Featured Projects

### [Invitro Medical Services Platform](https://www.invitro.md) 🏥
**The Problem**: 40+ clinics, thousands of daily calls, 10 years of duplicate patient records in legacy CRM without API webhooks.

**What I Did**:
- Designed master-slave deduplication algorithm resolving 1000s of duplicate records
- Built queue-based sync architecture — zero downtime across 40+ branches during migration
- Led 5-7 engineer team through 24 sprint cycles over 12 months
- Chose Laravel + Livewire over React for 40% faster delivery while maintaining interactivity

**Tech**: Laravel, Livewire, Redis, TNTSearch, PHP
**Impact**: 60-70% call center load reduction, <500ms search across 2,000+ medical tests

### Phundhub — SME Lending Platform 💰
**The Problem**: Build lending platform from scratch with complex loan calculations, risk assessment, and multi-platform synchronization.

**What I Did**:
- Architected full-cycle platform from database schema to API structure
- Integrated Experian (credit scoring), HelloSign (e-signatures), Plaid (banking data)
- Implemented Zoho CRM synchronization with 99.9% data consistency
- Delivered in 6 months with zero database migrations during development

**Tech**: Laravel, MySQL, PostgreSQL, REST API, Experian/Plaid/HelloSign APIs
**Impact**: Reduced credit decision time from days to hours, eliminated 80% manual data gathering

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

I choose technology based on project constraints, not popularity:

**Backend Architecture**: PHP, Laravel, Node.js, GraphQL, REST APIs
**Frontend**: Next.js, React, Vue.js, Livewire, TypeScript
**Data Layer**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis, TimescaleDB
**Integrations**: Experian, Plaid, HelloSign, Zoho CRM, Socket.io
**Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS, Git, CI/CD

**Decision-making philosophy**: Laravel + Livewire for rapid MVP delivery (40% faster than React SPA), PostgreSQL for complex queries, Redis for caching/queues, Socket.io for real-time features.

## 💡 My Approach

> "Most MVP failures aren't technical — they're communication failures"

I believe:
- The best architecture is the one your team can actually maintain
- Clarity costs less than rework
- Pragmatic technology choices beat popular ones
